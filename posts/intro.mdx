Welcome to https://prove.email! ZK Email is an open-source organization committed to establishing the foundation for decentralized identity verification and new user onboarding onto the blockchain. Our approach centers around users directly attesting to their information, while an open-source zk verifier verifies it. Notably, we are a non-custodial platform, ensuring that users have exclusive control over their funds.

## Understanding the Product

Explore our latest presentations breakdown on our [slides](http://slides.prove.email).

Get hands-on experience with our identity demos at [prove.email#demos](https://prove.email#demos). If you're interested in integrating these proofs into the proof of personhood ecosystem, please feel free to reach out to us!

Test our wallet demo on [sendeth.org](https://sendeth.org) and access the documentation on [docs.sendeth.org](http://docs.sendeth.org).

## Build with ZK Email!

We are actively seeking Solidity novices and veterans to test our extensions framework, enabling you to define a concise contract (our sample Uniswap extension is expected to be < 100 lines) to add new functionality to the email wallet. You're encouraged to develop your own protocol, and we will assist in auditing your extension and making it accessible to users!

For constructing your customized email proof, we recommend utilizing [our SDK on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40zk-email) to create custom circom circuits, smart contracts for zk-email, and JavaScript email parsing functions. Take advantage of our [regex_to_circom subpackage](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40zk-email) for developing unique regex circuits. We want to support you any way we can, for any inquiries about your specific use cases, don't hesitate to reach out to us on [Discord]() or find us [available on Telegram](https://t.me/yush_g)!

## Contributing to the Core Project

We actively encourage and seek open-source contributions! Get started by addressing an open issue in the [circuits repository](https://github.com/zkemail/zk-email-verify/issues) or the [relayer repository](https://github.com/zkemail/relayer/issues) (especially those marked for first-timers!). We offer grants for notable contributions to our ecosystem.

We are thrilled to engage with developers interested in building next-gen technology, designers seeking fresh challenges, and startup founders looking to build their tech stack around our open-source technology. Reach out to us for a list of hackathon ideas - the second-place winner at ZK Summit was a project built using our technology!
